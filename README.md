# bot-poster

This tool allows you to send a message to your Discord server through
a bot. So if you need to post as a different persona for making
your server more interesting, we've got you covered!

## Required parameters

This app requires these to send a message:

## How to format messages

### Emoji

1. Type the emoji you want to use in Discord
2. Add a backslash (` \ `) before it and send it. If it is a default emoji, you will see a unicode emoji like `ðŸ˜ƒ`. If it is a custom emoji, you will see the emoji name and ID like this: `<:Patreon:882723233042935848>`
3. Copy-paste the text you get as it is, it should work.
